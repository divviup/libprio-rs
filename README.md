Pure Rust implementation of [Prio](https://crypto.stanford.edu/prio/), a system for Private, Robust,
and Scalable Computation of Aggregate Statistics.

## Exposure Notifications Private Analytics

This crate is used in the [Exposure Notifications Private Analytics][enpa] system. This is supported
by the interfaces in modules `server` and `client` and is referred to in various places as Prio v2.
See [`prio-server`][prio-server] or the [ENPA whitepaper][enpa-whitepaper] for more details.

## Verifiable Distributed Aggregation Function

Crate `prio` also implements a [Verifiable Distributed Aggregation Function
(VDAF)][vdaf] called "Prio3", implemented in the `vdaf` module, allowing Prio to
be used in the [Distributed Aggregation Protocol][dap] protocol being developed
in the PPM working group at the IETF. This support is still evolving along with
the DAP and VDAF specifications.

### Draft versions and release branches

The `main` branch is under continuous development and will usually be partway between VDAF drafts.
libprio uses stable release branches to maintain implementations of different VDAF draft versions.
Crate `prio` version `x.y.z` is released from a corresponding `release/x.y` branch. We try to
maintain [Rust SemVer][semver] compatibility, meaning that API breaks only happen on minor version
increases (e.g., 0.10 to 0.11).

## Cargo Features

This crate defines the following feature flags:

|Name|Default feature?|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`crypto-dependencies`|Yes|Enables dependencies on various RustCrypto crates, and uses them to implement `PrgSha3` to support VDAFs.|
|`experimental`|No|Certain experimental APIs are guarded by this feature. They may undergo breaking changes in future patch releases, as an exception to semantic versioning.|
|`multithreaded`|No|Enables certain Prio3 VDAF implementations that use `rayon` for parallelization of gadget evaluations.|
|`prio2`|No|Enables the Prio v2 API, and a VDAF based on the Prio2 system.|
|`test-util`|No|For internal use only, to support the test suite and test vectors.|
