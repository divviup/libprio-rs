This crate does not contain any unsafe code, and does not use any items from
the standard library or other crates, aside from operations backed by
`std::ops`. All paths with array indexing use integer literals for indexes, so
there are no panics due to indexes out of bounds (as rustc would catch an
out-of-bounds literal index). I did not check whether arithmetic overflows
could cause a panic, and I am relying on the Coq code having satisfied the
necessary preconditions to ensure panics due to overflows are unreachable.
