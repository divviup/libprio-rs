This crate does not contain any unsafe code, and does not use any items from

there are no panics due to indexes out of bounds (as rustc would catch an
out-of-bounds literal index). I did not check whether arithmetic overflows
could cause a panic, and I am relying on the Coq code having satisfied the
necessary preconditions to ensure panics due to overflows are unreachable.
