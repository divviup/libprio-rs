zlib-rs uses unsafe Rust for invoking compiler intrinsics (i.e. SIMD), eschewing bounds checks, along the FFI boundary, and for interacting with pointers sourced from C. I have extensively reviewed and fuzzed the unsafe code. All findings from that work have been resolved as of version 0.4.0. To the best of my ability, I believe it's free of any serious security problems.

zlib-rs does not require any external dependencies.
