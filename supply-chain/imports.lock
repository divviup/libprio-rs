The new `getrandom_uninit` method is introduced by retrofitting every system
implementation to take `&mut [MaybeUninit<u8>]` instead of `&mut [u8]`.

Most implementations are only altered to update their signature, and to
internally cast the slice back to `*mut u8` when writing to it. All of these
backends appear to write bytes to the full length of the slice, so it should be
fully initialized afterwards, upholding the invariants of the new `unsafe` code
in the public APIs.

- I did not check the behaviour of each implementation's system method to ensure
  they never write uninitialized bytes; the code prior to this change already
  needed to uphold that invariant as it was writing into `&mut [u8]`.

The following system implementations have additional `unsafe` code modifications:

- `custom`: The slice is zero-filled to ensure the `MaybeUninit<u8>` doesn't
  escape into a system implementation that might not write initialized bytes
  into the entire slice. The internal API between registration and usage is also
  switched from C ABI to Rust ABI, to guard against potential panics.

- `emscripten`: New backend, implementation looks reasonable.

- `hermit`: New backend, writes incrementally to the slice, but ensures that the
  entire slice has been written to before returning `Ok(())`. I note that it is
  possible for the implementation to loop indefinitely if `sys_read_entropy`
  were to always return 0 for some reason.

- `js`: Adds chunking to limit each write to less than 2^31 (but that seems like
  a bugfix). The safety requirements for `Uint8Array::view_mut_raw` appear to be
  satisfied.

- `rdrand`: Code changes to better handle CPU families with broken RDRAND.

- `solaris_illumos`: Now uses `GRND_RANDOM`.

- `windows`: Added `RtlGenRandom` fallback for non-UWP Windows.
