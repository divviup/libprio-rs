`proc-macro2` acts as either a thin(-ish) wrapper around the std-provided
`proc_macro` crate, or as a fallback implementation of the crate, depending on
where it is used.

If using this crate on older versions of rustc (1.56 and earlier), it will
temporarily replace the panic handler while initializing in order to detect if
it is running within a `proc_macro`, which could lead to surprising behaviour.
This should not be an issue for more recent compiler versions, which support
`proc_macro::is_available()`.

The `proc-macro2` crate's fallback behaviour is not identical to the complex
behaviour of the rustc compiler (e.g. it does not perform unicode normalization
for identifiers), however it behaves well enough for its intended use-case
(tests and scripts processing rust code).

`proc-macro2` does not use unsafe code, however exposes one `unsafe` API to
allow bypassing checks in the fallback implementation when constructing
`Literal` using `from_str_unchecked`. This was intended to only be used by the
`quote!` macro, however it has been removed
(https://github.com/dtolnay/quote/commit/f621fe64a8a501cae8e95ebd6848e637bbc79078),
and is likely completely unused. Even when used, this API shouldn't be able to
cause unsoundness.

notes = """
The new `getrandom_uninit` method is introduced by retrofitting every system
implementation to take `&mut [MaybeUninit<u8>]` instead of `&mut [u8]`.

Most implementations are only altered to update their signature, and to
internally cast the slice back to `*mut u8` when writing to it. All of these
backends appear to write bytes to the full length of the slice, so it should be
fully initialized afterwards, upholding the invariants of the new `unsafe` code
in the public APIs.

- I did not check the behaviour of each implementation's system method to ensure
  they never write uninitialized bytes; the code prior to this change already
  needed to uphold that invariant as it was writing into `&mut [u8]`.

The following system implementations have additional `unsafe` code modifications:

- `custom`: The slice is zero-filled to ensure the `MaybeUninit<u8>` doesn't
  escape into a system implementation that might not write initialized bytes
  into the entire slice. The internal API between registration and usage is also
  switched from C ABI to Rust ABI, to guard against potential panics.

- `emscripten`: New backend, implementation looks reasonable.

- `hermit`: New backend, writes incrementally to the slice, but ensures that the
  entire slice has been written to before returning `Ok(())`. I note that it is
  possible for the implementation to loop indefinitely if `sys_read_entropy`
  were to always return 0 for some reason.

- `js`: Adds chunking to limit each write to less than 2^31 (but that seems like
  a bugfix). The safety requirements for `Uint8Array::view_mut_raw` appear to be
  satisfied.

- `rdrand`: Code changes to better handle CPU families with broken RDRAND.

- `solaris_illumos`: Now uses `GRND_RANDOM`.

- `windows`: Added `RtlGenRandom` fallback for non-UWP Windows.
